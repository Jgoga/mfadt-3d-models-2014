# Thesis Exhibition 2014 - 3D Portraits 
All 3D models and corresponding textures for the thesis exhibition portraits.

## How It Works
There is a folder for each student. Inside the folder are three files:
- **color.png** : the texture file used for basic colors captured by scanning software
- **TEXTURED_[name].obj** : the 3D model
- **TEXTURED_[name].obj.mtl** : material file, needed if you are adding the color.png material to the mesh

## Extra Info
You can use pretty much any 3D modeling software to open the files: Maya, 3ds Max, Blender, Mesh Lab, etc.

These 3D models were created using the software [Skanect](skanect.occipital.com). 

Feel free to use these 3D scans for printing, games, animations, etc. 

High resolution textures were also created to make the final 3D renders of the portraits. These files are too large to upload, so if you have a special request please contact Owen Herterich or Jorge Proa√±o.
